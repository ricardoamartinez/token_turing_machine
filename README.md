# TTM Multiplication Model Implementation Checklist

This repository implements a Token Turing Machine (TTM) model with a Transformer processing unit for learning multiplication of arbitrary numbers. The implementation follows the architecture described in the [Token Turing Machines paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09119) by Michael S. Ryoo et al. from Google Research.

Token Turing Machines (TTMs) are sequential, autoregressive models with external memory designed for efficient processing of sequential data. The key innovation is the use of token summarization to maintain a compact memory representation that summarizes relevant history, enabling constant computational cost regardless of sequence length.
