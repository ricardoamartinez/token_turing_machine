# Hardware Choice for TTM Implementation

## Benchmark Results

### Matrix Multiplication
- CPU: 0.0623 ms
- CUDA (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER): 0.0000 ms (too fast to measure accurately)
- Speedup: Extremely high (effectively infinite)

### Token Embedding
- CPU: 0.1322 ms
- CUDA (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER): 0.0000 ms (too fast to measure accurately)
- Speedup: Extremely high (effectively infinite)

### Transformer Operations
- CPU: 8.1049 ms
- CUDA (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER): 0.6193 ms
- Speedup: 13.09x

## Decision

Based on the benchmark results, we will use **CUDA on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER** for development and training of the Token Turing Machine model. The reasons for this choice are:

1. **Significant Performance Advantage**: The CUDA implementation shows a substantial speedup over CPU, especially for transformer operations which are central to the TTM architecture.

2. **Training Efficiency**: The TTM model will require training on large datasets with multiple epochs. The 13x speedup for transformer operations will significantly reduce training time.

3. **Memory Capacity**: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER has 16GB of VRAM, which is sufficient for training the TTM model with the memory size (m=96) and batch sizes specified in the paper.

4. **Future Scalability**: Using CUDA allows for easier scaling to larger models or datasets in the future.

## Implementation Considerations

- We will implement the model to work on both CPU and CUDA to ensure flexibility.
- We will use PyTorch's device-agnostic approach to make the code portable.
- For development and debugging, we may use CPU for simpler operations to allow for easier inspection of intermediate values.
- For performance-critical operations and full training runs, we will use CUDA.

## Fallback Strategy

In case of CUDA memory limitations or other issues, we have the following fallback strategies:

1. Reduce batch size
2. Use gradient accumulation
3. Implement model parallelism if necessary
4. Fall back to CPU for specific operations if needed
